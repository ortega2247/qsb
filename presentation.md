##Presentation

###Oversimplified models (exponential, Hills...)
* We can learn a bit about the biology of the system (Hills equation: cooperativity, etc)

###Model parameters reduction
* **Plot**: differences between the paper and the plot we got
* Reducing parameters can reduce predictability and resolution


###Critical parameters 
* Given a "good model", we can estimate which parameters are the most critical

###Some parameters are more important than others
* If we remove important parameters, we will get unreallistic models. In some cases, the parameter estimation algorithm will not converge
